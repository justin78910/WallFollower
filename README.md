Autonomous Wall Follower Robot Car
TM4C123GH6PM

This project requires the design and build of an autonomous wall following robot car. 
Two IR sensors are angled 45 degrees (from the forward direction) on both sides of the robot car.

Requirements: 
-Car must follow a prebuilt track with walls on both sides 
-The car must center itself equidistant from the left and right side walls

Doing this project will give you an understanding in the following areas: 
Basic Hardware Components 
GPIO
H-Bridge Motor Driver 
Hardware Timers
Interrupts
ADC 
Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI) 
Hardware PWM 
Onboard Switches 
Nokia LCD 
DC Motors 
Sharp IR Sensor

I did this project as an optional challenge in my Embedded Systems course at CSULB.
I referenced the lecture notes and used the knowledge from each section of the course
to complete this project. To fully understand the code and what is going on,
make sure to study up on each topic mentioned above with respect to the 
TM4C123GH6PM - Hello Launchpad board.
